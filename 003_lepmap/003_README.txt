Here (003_lepmap/) are the files after filtrarion.R, which were converted to .vcf using TASSLE5
To work, you will need to install the LepMap3 software package (https://sourceforge.net/projects/lep-map3/)
and specify the correct path to it in the lepmap.sh script and run this script
As a result, you will get the number of folders equal to the number of your chromosomes (20 in our case)
Each folder will contain information about the analysis and the result of this analysis
These folders will be moved to the following folder (004_analisis/data/mapping/) for further analysis
